Autosar Communication stack
AUTOSAR Architecture was introduced to promote standardization in the software development process of Automotive Electronic Control Units (ECU).

Prior to the introduction of AUTOSAR standard, ECU software functions had to be rewritten completely at the time of migration to a new hardware platform.

AUTOSAR Architecture introduced the concept of AUTOSAR MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer) to ensure that application software was completely independent of the hardware platform. This, in turn, made the software reusable and modular.

Another core aspect of the AUTOSAR architecture is ECU Communication. We will discuss this aspect in detail with the help of AUTOSAR Communication Stack.

A typical AUTOSAR Communication Stack has its modules in three sub layers of the Basic Software Layer:

Services Layer
ECU Abstraction Layer
MCAL
Some of the important software modules in this stack are as follows:

AUTOSAR COM – part of the Services Layer
Bus Specific Interface Modules – part of the ECU Abstraction Layer (For example -CANIF, LINIF)
External Bus Drivers – part of the ECU Abstraction Layer (For example – External drivers like CANDrv, LINDrv, FlexrayDrv)
Bus Transceiver Driver – part of the ECU Abstraction Layer
Internal Bus Drivers – part of the AUTOSAR MCAL (For example – CANDrv, LINDrv, FRDrv)
Sub modules such as Bus Network Management, Bus State Manager, Bus Transport Protocol, Bus Interface and Bus Driver facilitate the communication. Each of these modules has specific roles to play.
